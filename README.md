# Capstone Project Fall 2023 - NYU Abu Dhabi

## Project Overview
This capstone project, led by Majid Ibrahim, investigates the relationship between the gut microbiome and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using machine learning. It addresses the urgent need for early and accurate ASD diagnosis, considering the limitations of current diagnostic methods and the disparities in care due to costs and accessibility.

## Background
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) causes problems with socialization, communication, and behavior. Recent studies have connected ASD to the gut microbiome, comprising bacteria and other organisms in the digestive tract. This project aims to develop cost-effective ASD diagnosis and treatment options based on gut microbiota and machine learning, boosting long-term outcomes.

## Project Objectives
1. **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Establish machine learning algorithms to predict ASD using gut microbiome data.
2. **Key Biomarkers**: Identify biomarkers to understand ASDâ€™s biological underpinnings and suggest potential pathways for early detection and intervention.
3. **Diagnostic Tool**: Create a diagnostic tool for early detection of ASD.

## Experimental Results
The study's primary results focused on the machine learning model's accuracy and the identification of significant features through feature selection. The model's accuracy is crucial as it reflects the ability to correctly predict ASD based on gut microbiome data. Significant features identified are essential for understanding the biological and microbial factors associated with ASD.

### Model Performance
- Models such as AdaBoost with Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression were evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1 Score, and AUC.
- A detailed examination was conducted on nine different models, with Naive Bayes and Random Forest models showing outstanding results in various feature selection methods.

### Significant Features
- Two feature selection methods, ANOVA f-test and Mutual Information Gain, were employed to identify crucial features for the machine learning models aimed at detecting ASD.
- The focus was on Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) that are most predictive of ASD.

## Conclusion
This research significantly advances the use of machine learning in medical science, especially in the context of neurological disorders like ASD. The insights gained not only enhance scientific understanding of ASD but also pave the way for practical applications that can profoundly impact individuals affected by this condition.
