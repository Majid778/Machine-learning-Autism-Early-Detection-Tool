# Capstone Project Fall 2023 - NYU Abu Dhabi

## Project Overview
This capstone project explores the association between the gut microbiota and the early identification of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) through machine learning. The study addresses the urgent need for early and accurate diagnosis of ASD, considering the challenges and limitations of current diagnostic methods.

## Motivation and Contributions
### Motivation
The study is motivated by the significant impact that early screening and diagnosis of ASD can have on the long-term outcomes for children. Early identification is crucial for enhancing the developmental trajectory and quality of life for these children.

### Contributions
1. **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Establishing the capability of machine learning algorithms to predict ASD using gut microbiome data.
2. **Key Biomarkers**: Identifying biomarkers that contribute to understanding ASD's biological underpinnings.
3. **Diagnostic Tool**: Creating a tool for the early detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder.

## Related Work
The project references various studies, including research on parent-mediated interventions for infants at risk of developing ASD, highlighting the benefits of early intervention.

## Experimental Results
The study focuses on:
- **Accuracy of Machine Learning Model**: Reflecting the model's ability to correctly identify and predict ASD based on gut microbiome data.
- **Significant Features**: Understanding the underlying biological and microbial factors associated with ASD through feature selection.

## Conclusion and Impact
The research marks a significant advancement in the use of machine learning in medical science, particularly in the context of neurological disorders such as ASD. It enhances scientific understanding and paves the way for practical applications that can impact individuals affected by this condition.

- **Machine Learning Efficacy**: Emphasizing the efficacy of Random Forest and Naive Bayes algorithms.
- **Critical Biomarkers**: Identifying biomarkers within the gut microbiome.
- **Developmental Tool**: Developing a non-invasive, efficient, and accessible detection tool for early ASD detection.

The tool is designed as an aid in screening for ASD, guiding individuals toward professional medical evaluation and diagnosis. This study contributes significantly to both scientific understanding and practical applications in the realm of ASD.
